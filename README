Workflow
========

Workflow was created by Milk-it Software House (milk-it.net) to help on
daily tasks such as test software and commit. This helps commiting code only
if all your tests pass.

Example
=======

# Commit your code using Workflow
$ rake svn:ci 

# Coverage test using Workflow + rCov
$ rake test:coverage
